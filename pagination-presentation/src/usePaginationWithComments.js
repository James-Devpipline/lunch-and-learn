/*
What is needed for pagination?
  - Data that you will sort through
  - Number of cards per page
  - buttons to navigate to the next and previous page/set of cards.


  - MATH NEEDED
    - need to find the amount of pages you will have according to the amount of items you want on screen
    - need to slice through data by finding the current position and items per page
*/

    // With end, if currentPosition is 0, and items per page is 7, end will return 6. If instead currentPosition is 1, start will then return with 7, then end will return 14. Keeping a range of itemsPerPage (in this case 7) when slicing
